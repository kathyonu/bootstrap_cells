Cells for Twitter Bootstrap components

I recently ran into the fact that formtastic and simple_form were lagging in their support for Twitter Bootstrap 3, so I figured that I would use Cells (https://github.com/apotonick/cells), since they are a better approach, anyway. With Cells, you can create objects in Rails that act more like true components -- they encapsulate presentation and behavior of UI elements in neat little self-contained packages.
